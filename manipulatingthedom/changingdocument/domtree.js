// DOM TREE

// Every HTML tag is an object. 

// Nested tags are children of the enclosing one.

// the text inside a tag is an object as well.

// all are accessible with javascript



// AN EXAMPLE OF DOM

// tags are called element nodes, or just elements.

// text inside elements form text nodes. 
// A TEXT NODE CONTAINS ONLY A STRING.
// a text node may not have children.

// AUTOCORRECTION

// IF THE BROWSER ENCOUTERS MALFORMED HTML, IT AUTOMATICALLY CORRECTS IT.

// COMMENTS ARE ALSO ADDED AS NODES TO THE DOM TREE.

// EVERYTHING IN THE HTML BECOMES PART OF THE DOM.

// 12 NODE TYPES
// WE WILL BE USUALLY BE WORKING WITH 4 OF THEM:

// 1. DOCUMENT - THE ENTRY POINT INTO DOM
// 2. ELEMENT NODES - HTML TAGS, THE TREE BUILDING BLOCKS
// 3. TEXT NODES - CONTAIN TEXT.
// 4. COMMENTS - SOMETIMES WE CAN PUT THE INFORMATION THERE, IT WON'T BE SHOWN, BUT JS CAN READ IT FROM THE DOM.
